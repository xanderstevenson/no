# I Need to Rename This Project

---------------

## A Presentation and Interactive Coding & IoT Activity for Cisco DevNet.

- **Project Manager**: Alexander Stevenson							


- **Purpose**: Abstract for Interactive Coding / IoT Presentation


- **Organization**: Cisco DevNet, Developer Success (managed by Paul Zimmerman)


- **Date**: August 16, 2021


- **Concept**: Three ringable metal bells (see image below under Equipment) will a simple and small three ring coat rack. At least one sensor will be placed near the bells and measure sound / frequency so that each bell can be differentiated from the others and will be able to activate a process in a unique way (assuming each bell rings at a sperate frequency from each other, as well as from any sounds in the immediate environment.

	I will use a Raspberry Pi (probably) for compute power, along with a compatible sensor. The sensor will be connected physically (Cat5/6 Ethernet). The 	Raspberry Pi, acting as the Controller, will connect to the Network through WiFi or similar transmission medium which is conducive to this project and environment. 

	For the interactive portion, we (DevNet) will develop a script which will be able to recognize the different bell sounds and initiate different actions based on those stimuli, such as turning devices on/off, and/or sending or receiving data (to name a few). The users will be asked to adjust the script, used basic timing methods built into Python, so that by reproducing that pattern on the bells they can initiate one of the actions listed above. Advanced users could even work on coding unique actions to be performed (we will provide code-snippet templates to assist).

- **Motivation**

In my never-ending quest for peak efficiency (emphasis on never-ending), I’ve formulated a concept where scripts can be activated by IoT sensors that measure sound and/or pitch. Thus, the ringing of three non-identical bells will make three distinct sounds which in turn can activate different script or parts of a script into action.


- **Equipment**

	-	Bell x 3

	-	Rack with hooks (for holding rope on top of bells) x 1

	-	Raspberry Pi 4B

	-	[QuadMic 4-Microphone Array for Raspberry Pi](https://makersportal.com/shop/quadmic-4-microphone-array) x 1 - sensor for measuring sound / frequency. The QuadMic Array is a 4-microphone array based around the AC108 quad-channel analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with Inter-IC Sound (I2S) audio output capable of interfacing with the Raspberry Pi. The QuadMic can be used for applications in voice detection and recognition, acoustic localization, noise control, and other applications in audio and acoustic analysis.
